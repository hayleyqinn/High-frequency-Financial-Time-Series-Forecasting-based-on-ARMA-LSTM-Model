# High-frequency Financial Time Series Forecasting based on ARMA-LSTM Model 

This research proposes a hybrid model that uses a recurrent neural network called long and short-term memory (LSTM) to improve the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. ARMA filters the stationary trends in the data and passes the residuals to the LSTM model.
